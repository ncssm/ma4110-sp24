    "It would be helpful to create a line plot of the PTER over time to see how it has changed over the years. Unfortunately, the `Date` column is a string that can't be used as the independent variable of a line plot. You will need to create a new column, `Year`, that represents the year as a `float`. For example, January 1994 should be represented at `1994.0`, February 2000 should be represented as `2000.0833333333` (`0.0833333333` is $\\approx \\frac{1}{12}$), March 2020 would be represented as `2020.1666666667` and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, think about how you could quickly create an array of these `float` values using a `numpy` function. Remember, the first row of the data starts with January 1994 (`1994.0`) and each row increases the year value by one twelfth of a year. Store this array to the name `year_array`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, add both the `year_array` array and the `pter` array to the original `unemployment` table. Label these columns `Year` and `PTER`. \n",
