    "Welcome to MA4110: *Foundations of Data Science*!  Each week you will complete a lab assignment like this one.  You can't learn technical subjects without hands-on practice, so labs are an important part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask a neighbor or an instructor for help. Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it. You should **not** _just_ copy/paste someone else's code, but rather work together to gain understanding of the task you need to complete. \n",

    "1. navigate Jupyter notebooks (like this one);\n",
    "2. write and evaluate some basic *expressions* in Python, the computer language of the course;\n",
    "3. call *functions* to use code other people have written; and\n",
    "4. break down Python code into smaller parts to understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab covers parts of [Chapter 3](http://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/03/programming-in-python.html) of the online textbook. You should read the examples in the book, but not right now. Instead, let's get started!"

When a cell is finished running, you'll see a number inside the brackets, like so: `[1]`.

And we thought where would be a better place to confirm his findings than on the Moon. And so we thought we'd try it here for you. The feather happens to be, appropriately, a falcon feather for our Falcon. And I'll drop the two of them here and, hopefully, they'll hit the ground at the same time. \n",
