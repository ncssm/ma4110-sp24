Because it is a snapshot, the database may not accurately reflect an employee's permanent salary or all sources of funding provided throughout the year. As examples, the database may not capture all external fund sources that may compensate some employees, or the information may capture temporary salary increases or temporary title changes for additional duties for an employee that could change in the course of the year.\n",

Perhaps only those people who can keep working into their 60s or 70s do jobs that inherently pay more than those that can't be completed by employees of that age?
