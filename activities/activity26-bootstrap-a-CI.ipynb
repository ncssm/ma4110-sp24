    "Remember, our goal is to estimate the average nightly price of all Airbnb's in Asheville, NC. As discussed in the lessons, the best way to make such an estimate is to construct a confidence interval. As we've seen, larger sample sizes produce more narrow confidence intervals, meaning we have a more precise estimate of our value. However, larger samples are more expensive to take in real life (you have to spend either more time or more money to get more data in your sample). There's an inherent trade off between cost and accuracy, and when solving your own problems you have to decide how much the additional accuracy is worth to you! In a future lesson you'll learn a method for determining what size sample you should take in order to achieve a certain level of accuracy, but for now choose a sample size between 50 and 200 to use and assign it to the variable `sample_size` in the code cell below.\n",

You'd never know the details of how other samples and other resamples might have impacted how it *could* have gone differently. Do any of these Confidence Intervals fail to capture the true average that we were trying to predict? The true average price is drawn in as a vertical red line. If any of your yellow bars don't contain the red line, that means if you had constructed that as your confidence interval it would have NOT been a good estimate for the mean price.
